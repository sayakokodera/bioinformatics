# Bioinformatics Learning Repository

This repository contains a collection of python scripts and Jupyter notebooks to document my journey learning bioinformatics concepts, tools, and applications. The repository serves as both a personal reference and a showcase of various bioinformatics techniques I've explored.

## Purpose

This repository serves as:
1. A personal learning resource for bioinformatics concepts
2. A reference for common bioinformatics workflows
3. A showcase of practical applications in computational biology
4. A collection of code snippets for future projects

## Repository Structure

### Genomics
A collection of notebooks focused on genomic analysis techniques. I've been following the topics covered in [lanadominkovic's _12 days of Biopython_](https://github.com/lanadominkovic/12-days-of-biopython/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file) 

- blast_example.ipynb: Usage of BLAST for sequence similarity searching
- fastq_handling_example.ipynb: Working with FASTQ files for sequencing data
- ncbi_fetch_example.ipynb: How to retrieve data from NCBI databases
- sequence_alignments_example.ipynb: Methods for aligning biological sequences
- covid19_genome_analysis.ipynb: Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomic data

### Heart Disease Analysis
- heart_disease_1/main.ipynb: Analysis of heart disease dataset using different classifiers


### Microbiome
- (WIP) will be explored soon

## Tools & Technologies Used

- Python for data analysis and visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning
- Biopython for biological sequence manipulation
- Various bioinformatics databases (e.g. NCBI)


## Future Directions
Areas I plan to explore in the future:
- RNA-seq analysis
- Protein structure prediction
- Microbiome analysis
- Metagenomics analysis
